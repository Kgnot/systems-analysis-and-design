# Workshop 1

For the analysis, we began by reviewing the context of the competition, which involved the development of real-time educational games. The main objective was to predict player performance. First, we identified all the components of the system, along with their respective inputs and outputs. We then analyzed the relationships between these elements. To do this, we used data from the dataset that we considered representative of both the internal components of the system and the broader context. Once this structure was defined, we examined how inputs in specific parts of the system affected its overall behavior. Finally, we applied case theory to analyze the randomness within the system, particularly in relation to its inputs.
